## Getting Started

The WSO2 Integrator: MI documentation provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and reference materials for working with the **WSO2 Integrator: MI** platform.

- **Documentation Website**: [https://mi.docs.wso2.com/](https://mi.docs.wso2.com/)
- **Repository Structure**:

  - `docs-mi/en/docs/` : Contains all the `.md` files with content.

    > **Tip**:
    > `docs-mi/en/docs/` directory is referred to by {{base_path}} throughout the documentation.

    ```html
    e.g.
    <a
      href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/develop/mi-for-vscode/mi-vscode-extension.png"
      ><img
        src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/develop/mi-for-vscode/mi-vscode-extension.png"
        alt="Mi VS Code Extension"
        width="80%"
    /></a>
    ```

  - `docs-mi/en/docs/assets` : Contains all the resources (images/attachments/videos) used throughout the documentation

  - `docs-mi/en/docs/mkdocs.yaml` : The configuration file used by MkDocs, a static site generator that's geared towards project documentation. It defines the structure, theme, plugins, and other settings for building and deploying the documentation site.

    > **Tip** : You have to update `nav` section in `mkdocs.yaml` for new pages you add.

    ```yml
    nav:
      - Home: index.md
      - Get Started:
          - Introduction: get-started/introduction.md
          - Key Concepts: get-started/key-concepts.md
          - Quick Start Guide: get-started/quick-start-guide.md
    ```

  - `docs-mi/en/docs/requirements.txt` : This file lists all the Python dependencies required to build and run the documentation site locally. These dependencies include MkDocs and its plugins, which are essential for generating and serving the static site.

python3 --version

# Install pip if needed
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
```

**Windows**:

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
