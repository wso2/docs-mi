### Install and run WSO2 Integration Studio

Follow the steps given below.

1.  Go to the [API Manager Tooling web page](https://wso2.com/api-management/tooling/), and download WSO2 Integration Studio.

    !!! Note
        * If you are a MacOS user, be sure to add it to the **Applications** directory.
        * If you are a Microsoft Windows user, extract it outside the **Programs** directory. This is done because the Integration Studio requires permission to write to files.
        
3.  Run the **Integration Studio** application to start the tool.
