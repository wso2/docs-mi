# Troubleshoot MI for VS Code

The following are some ways to troubleshoot errors you may encounter when working with the WSO2 Integrator: MI for Visual Studio Code extension (MI for VS Code).

## Resolve graphical view errors

To address issues such as frozen views or errors while designing integrations using the graphical view, follow these steps:

1. Open the VS Code Command Palette by selecting **View** > **Command Palette** from the menu, or by using the shortcut `Command`+`Shift`+`P` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` on Windows.

2. Select **Developer: Reload Window** from the list of commands.

Refreshing the MI for VS Code extension resolves common errors in the graphical view and restores normal functionality.
