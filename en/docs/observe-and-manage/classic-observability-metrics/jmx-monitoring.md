# JMX Monitoring

Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a technology that lets you implement management interfaces for Java applications. A management interface, as defined by JMX is composed of named objects called MBeans (Management Beans). MBeans are registered with a name (an ObjectName) in an MBeanServer. To manage a resource or many resources in your application, you can write an MBean defining its management interface and register that MBean in your MBeanServer. The content of the MBeanServer can then be exposed through various protocols, implemented by protocol connectors or protocol adaptors.

!!! note
    Prometheus-based monitoring is recommended for remote monitoring in more recent versions of the WSO2 Integrator: MI.

## Configuring JMX in WSO2 Integrator: MI

With [**JConsole**](#monitoring-with-jconsole), you can attach the WSO2 Integrator: MI as a local process and monitor the MBeans that are provided. There is nothing explicitly enable. 

## Monitoring with JConsole

Jconsole is a JMX-compliant monitoring tool, which comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK). You can find this tool inside your `<JDK_HOME>/bin` directory.

### Starting JConsole
        
Once the **product server is started**, you can start the `JConsole` tool as follows:

1.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the `<JDK_HOME>/bin` directory.
2.  Execute the `jconsole` command to open the log-in screen of the **Java Monitoring & Management Console** as
    shown below.

3.  Click on the  `org.wso2.micro.integrator.bootstrap.Bootstrap` process (which is the WSO2 Integrator: MI) under the Local Process.
4.  Click **Connect** to open the **Java Monitoring & Management Console**. 
     
     See the **Oracle** documentation on [using
    JConsole](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html). The following tabs will be available:  

    -   **Overview**

         [![jconsole overview]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-overview.png){: style="width:90%")}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-overview.png)

    -   **Memory**

         [![jconsole memory]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-memory.png){: style="width:90%")}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-memory.png)

    -   **Threads**

         [![jconsole threads]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-threads.png){: style="width:90%")}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-threads.png)

    -   **Classes**
        
         [![jconsole classes]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-classes.png){: style="width:90%")}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-classes.png)

    -   **VM**
        
         [![jconsole VM]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-vm-summary.png){: style="width:90%")}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/jmx/jconsole-vm-summary.png)

    -   **MBeans**

See the list of [WSO2 Integrator: MI MBeans](#mbeans-for-the-micro-integrator) that you can monitor.

## Monitoring a WSO2 product with Jolokia

[Jolokia](https://jolokia.org) is a JMX-HTTP bridge, which is an alternative to JSR-160 connectors. It is an agent-based approach that supports many platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations, it enhances JMX monitoring with unique features like bulk requests and fine-grained security policies.

Follow the steps below to use Jolokia to monitor a WSO2 product using a JVM Agent. 
It can be dynamically attached (and
detached) to an already running Java process. This universal agent uses the JVM agent API and is available for every Sun/Oracle JVM 1.6 and later.

1. Download the [JVM-Agent](https://jolokia.org/download.html) (version 2.4.0).
2. Add it to the `<MI_HOME>/dropins/` directory.
3. Start the WSO2 product server.
4. Get the PID of the WSO2 server.
5. Start the JVM Agent. Example: java -jar jolokia-jvm-2.4.0-agent.jar start <PID> --host localhost --port 9763
6. You can call it with --help to get usage information: java -jar jolokia-jvm-2.4.0-agent.jar --help

   Once the server starts, you can read MBeans using Jolokia APIs. The following are a few examples.

   - List all available MBeans: `http://localhost:9763/jolokia/list` (Change the appropriate hostname and port accordingly.)
   - WSO2 ESB MBean:
     ```
     http://localhost:9763/jolokia/read/org.apache.synapse:Name=https-sender,Type=PassThroughConnections/ActiveConnections
     ```
     
   - Reading Heap Memory: `http://localhost:9763/jolokia/read/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage`

Follow the steps below to use Jolokia to monitor a WSO2 product using OSGi Agent.

1. Download the [Osgi-Agent (full bundle)](https://jolokia.org/download.html) (version 2.4.0).
2. Add it to the `<MI_HOME>/dropins/` directory.
3. Start the WSO2 product server.
4. You can define the port with system variables. E.g., `./micro-integrator.sh -Dorg.osgi.service.http.port=9763`

    Once the server starts, you can read MBeans using Jolokia APIs. The following are a few examples.

    - List all available MBeans: `http://localhost:9763/jolokia/list` (Change the appropriate hostname and port accordingly.)
    - WSO2 ESB MBean:
        ```
        http://localhost:9763/jolokia/read/org.apache.synapse:Name=https-sender,Type=PassThroughConnections/ActiveConnections
        ```

    - Reading Heap Memory: `http://localhost:9763/jolokia/read/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage`

## MBeans for the WSO2 Integrator: MI

When JMX is enabled, the WSO2 Integrator: MI exposes a number of management resources as
JMX Management Beans (MBeans) that can be used for managing and
monitoring the running server.  When you start JConsole, you can monitor
these MBeans from the **MBeans** tab. Most of the MBeans are exposed from the underlying Synapse mediation engine.

## Disabling the JMX thread view

Dumping JMX threads is an expensive operation that affects the CPU
consumption when many threads are being processed at the same time.

The WSO2 Integrator: MI has enabled thread dumping by default. Therefore, to avoid
dumping all the threads
[here](https://github.com/wso2/wso2-synapse/blob/master/modules/commons/src/main/java/org/apache/synapse/commons/jmx/ThreadingView.java#L268), you can configure the property given below.

!!! Info
    It is recommended not to dump the thread especially when you have enabled analytics in a production environment.

1.  Open the `MI_HOME/conf/deployment.toml` file.
2.  Add the following property to the file and save the file.
    ```toml
    [synapse_properties]
    'synapse.jmx.thread.view.enabled'=false
    ```
-->
