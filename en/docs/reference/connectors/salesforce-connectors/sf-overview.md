# Salesforce Connectors Overview

Salesforce is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution that helps bridge the gap between customers and enterprises. This enables you to integrate with Salesforce and perform various actions with ease. This is done using connectors that interact with available Salesforce APIs. 

### Salesforce connector

The Salesforce connector allows you to work with records in Salesforce. You can use the Salesforce connector to create, query, retrieve, update, and delete records in your organization's Salesforce data. The connector uses the [Salesforce SOAP API](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/), [Salesforce Bulk API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/api_asynch_introduction_how_bulk_api_works.htm/) and [Salesforce REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_list.htm) to interact with Salesforce.
