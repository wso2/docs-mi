# Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) Connector Overview

Intelligent Document Processing is an AI-powered approach for extracting relevant information from unstructured or semi-structured documents, such as PDFs and images. It converts this information into well-organized, structured data. The Intelligent Document Processing Connector enables you to extract structured data from documents like PDFs and images within an integration sequence, with or without any LLM cost.
