# HTTP Connector Overview

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a foundational protocol used for transferring data enabling communication between clients and servers.

The HTTP Connector enables communication with APIs by supporting operations for HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS. It facilitates sending requests over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

To see the HTTP Connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com) and search for "http".
