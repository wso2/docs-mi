## Creating Advanced Dashboards

This section will help you to setup advanced dashboards using custom metadata. Use [this documentation](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/kibana-dashboard) by Elastic to explore what kind of dashboard widgets you can create.
  
Assume you have a user registration AP deployed through a WSO2 Integrator: MI, which accepts JSON POST requests, and within that request, the body contains user age and country. You can publish the age and country with API analytics and create a visualization in the Kibana dashboard.

Example API:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<api xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="userRegistrationAPI" context="/user">
   <resource methods="POST" uri-template="/signup">
      <inSequence>
         <property name="newUserAge" expression="${payload.age}" scope="analytics" type="INTEGER" />
         <property name="newUserLocation" expression="${payload.country}" scope="analytics"/>
         <respond/>
      </inSequence>
   </resource>
</api>
```

To add data into the publishing analytics, you can use the Property Mediator. Any data that you add to the ANALYTICS scope will be published to Elastic Stack. In this example, age and country are being added into the analytics scope as `newUserAge` and `newUserLocation`.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2022-07-20T14:03:16.190979Z",
  "payload": {
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "entityType": "API",
    "metadata": {
      "newUserAge": 28,
      "newUserLocation": "AU"
    },
    "latency": 1,
    "apiDetails": {
      "method": "POST",
      "apiContext": "/user",
      "subRequestPath": "/signup",
      "api": "userRegistrationAPI",
    },
    "faultResponse": false,
  },
  "serverInfo": { â€¦ },
  "schemaVersion": 1
}

```

These custom data will be published under `metadata` inside the `payload`.
