# Introduction

**WSO2 Integrator: MI** provides a comprehensive integration solution that streamlines your digital transformation journey. It offers a powerful configuration-driven approach, allowing developers to build integration solutions with a user-friendly, low-code graphical design experience.

This hybrid platform supports various integration architecture styles, including:
- Microservices
- Cloud-native architectures  
- Centralized ESB architecture

The platform provides deployment options for both microservices and ESB styles, giving you flexibility when connecting applications, services, data, and cloud resources.

## Overview

WSO2 Integrator: MI enables seamless integration between systems, applications, and data sources. It provides powerful tools for designing, implementing, and managing integration workflows efficiently.

## Address every integration challenge with ease

### Effortlessly connect your business and partners

WSO2 Integrator: MI offers a streamlined approach to connect your business with partners. You can:

- Establish seamless connections using any communication protocol
- Handle diverse data types and formats
- Deploy across various environments including virtual machines, Kubernetes, on-premises infrastructure, and cloud-based systems

Our user-friendly graphical interface helps you efficiently create integration solutions without extensive coding.

### API-centric integration capabilities

Transform any service or data source into reusable APIs with WSO2 Integrator: MI. You can easily expose:

- RESTful services
- SOAP web services  
- WebSockets
- And many other service types

This API-centric approach enhances flexibility and reusability of your integration solutions.

### Enable enterprise modernization

This open-source integration platform helps you:

- Connect systems using established open standards
- Interface with legacy or proprietary services
- Ensure reliable access to all your data
- Modernize enterprise operations for greater efficiency

## Low-code integration

The WSO2 Integrator: MI for Visual Studio Code (MI for VS Code) extension lets developers use the popular Visual Studio Code editor for integration development. This AI-assisted development environment provides:

- Faster development cycles
- Customizable workflows
- Easy learning curve
- High productivity

## Flexible deployment options

Enterprises need adaptable integration solutions that evolve with business requirements. Our platform scales with your organization and supports:

- Traditional integration approaches
- Cloud-native methodologies
- Contemporary integration patterns

### Microservice integration

Deploy WSO2 integration runtime to host composite microservices that combine low-code integration with microservices architecture (MSA) benefits.

If your organization uses decentralized cloud-native architecture where microservices integrate APIs, events, and systems, WSO2 Integrator: MI can function as your integration (micro)services and API (micro)services.

### Enterprise Service Bus

For API-driven, centralized integration architecture, WSO2 Integrator: MI serves as the central integration layer. It implements message mediation logic that connects:

- Systems and data
- Events and APIs  
- Your entire integration ecosystem

When deployed as an ESB, the platform supports:

- Message routing and transformation
- Message mediation
- Service orchestration
- All enterprise integration patterns

## Connectors and Templates

### Extensive repository of pre-configured connectors

Connect quickly to various systems including:

- Payments platforms
- CRM and ERP systems
- Social networks
- Core services

Our repository includes 200+ enterprise-ready connectors and adapters for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems like SAP, IBM WebSphere MQ, Oracle AQ, and MSMQ.

### Seamless custom connector development

Build custom connectors easily using:

- Software Development Kits (SDKs)
- Web APIs
- Any underlying technology

### Enhancing efficiency and conformity

Jumpstart projects with pre-built integration templates that:

- Use established patterns
- Are fully customizable
- Can be tailored to your requirements
- Allow creation of your own templates

## Powerful data transformation and integration

Data drives business operations. Since different systems handle data uniquely, quick extraction and utilization is essential for modern applications and services.

### Efficient data exposure

Transform data sources into API endpoints or services in minutes using MI for VS Code. Our integrated data integration wizard provides step-by-step guidance.

### Simplified complex data transformation

Handle complex data transformations without manual coding using:

- FreeMarker Templates
- XSLT
- Other out-of-the-box tools

### Visual data mapping

Our intuitive visual data mapper supports:

- Data transformation between JSON, XML, CSV, and other formats
- Drag-and-drop graphical interface
- Workflow creation without manual coding

### Key Benefits

- Easy data transformation between multiple formats
- Drag-and-drop interface for workflow creation
- Support for real-time and batch data integration
- Extensible and configurable for enterprise use
