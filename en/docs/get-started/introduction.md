The **WSO2 Micro Integrator** provides a comprehensive integration solution that streamlines your digital transformation
journey. It offers a powerful configuration-driven approach, allowing developers to build integration solutions 
graphically, with a user-friendly low-code graphical designing experience. 
This hybrid platform supports a variety of integration architecture styles, including microservices, cloud-native, 
and centralized ESB architecture, providing deployment options for both microservices and ESB styles to enhance 
flexibility in connecting applications, services, data, and the cloud.


## Address every integration challenge with ease

### Effortlessly connect your business and partners
The WSO2 Micro Integrator offers a streamlined approach to connect your business and partners. 
It empowers you to establish seamless connections, irrespective of the communication protocol, 
handle diverse data types, and function within a broad range of environments, encompassing virtual machines, 
Kubernetes, on-premises infrastructure, and cloud-based systems. 
This capability is made achievable through our user-friendly and resilient graphical interface, 
enabling you to efficiently create integration solutions.


### API-centric integration capabilities
The Micro Integrator offers the ability to transform any service or data source into a reusable API. 
You can easily expose a wide array of services, including RESTful services, SOAP web services, WebSockets, and more. 
This empowers you to encapsulate your services, allowing you to parameterize and render them as reusable integrations. 
This API-centric approach enhances the flexibility and reusability of your integration solutions.

### Enable enterprise modernization
This open-source integration platform offers a seamless means to connect systems in accordance with established 
open standards, interface with legacy or proprietary services and systems, 
and assure reliable access to all of your data. 
This solution is designed to facilitate the modernization of your enterprise, fostering greater efficiency 
and connectivity in your operations.


## Low code integration

The Micro Integrator for Visual Studio Code (MI for VS Code) extension empowers developers to leverage the widely adopted 
Visual Studio Code editor for integration development, elevating the integration experience to new heights. This AI-assisted 
development environment delivers a faster, more customizable, easier-to-learn, and highly productive development experience.

## Flexible deployment options

Enterprises necessitate adaptable integration solutions capable of accommodating evolving business requirements. 
Our platform seamlessly scales in tandem with your organization, providing support for a spectrum of 
integration approaches, encompassing traditional, cloud-native, and other contemporary methodologies.


### Microservice integration
Deploy the WSO2 integration runtime to host composite microservices that can harness the power of 
a low-code integration approach while reaping the benefits of MSA.

As shown above, if your organization is running on a decentralized cloud-native, integration architecture 
where microservices are used for integrating the various APIs, events, and systems,
WSO2 Micro Integrator can easily function as your Integration (micro) services and API (micro) services.

### Enterprise Service Bus

If your organization utilizes an API-driven, centralized integration architecture, the Micro Integrator can serve as the central integration layer. It implements the message mediation logic that connects all systems, data, events, APIs, and other elements within your integration ecosystem.

When deployed as an ESB, the platform supports message routing, transformation, message mediation, 
service orchestration, and any enterprise integration pattern.

## Connectors and Templates

### Extensive repository of pre-configured connectors
This comprehensive offering facilitates swift connectivity to a broad spectrum of systems, encompassing payments, 
CRM, ERP, social networks, and core services. Our repository comprises more than 200 enterprise-ready connectors. 
Moreover, it comes equipped with adapters designed for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems such as SAP, 
IBM WebSphere MQ, Oracle AQ, and MSMQ.

### Seamless custom connector development
Our platform streamlines the process of crafting bespoke connectors. 
Utilizing Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Web APIs, you can effortlessly construct custom connectors that 
possess the capacity to interface with any system, regardless of its underlying technology.

### Enhancing efficiency and conformity
We offer a collection of pre-established integration templates, empowering you to promptly initiate new projects 
by employing established patterns. These templates are fully adaptable, 
ensuring they can be tailored to your precise requirements. Additionally, 
you have the flexibility to create your own templates and patterns, 
enabling a tailored approach that suits your unique needs.

## Powerful data transformation and data integration
Data plays a pivotal role in driving business operations. 
Given the unique data handling methods across different systems, the expeditious extraction 
and utilization of this data is paramount for the development of contemporary applications and services 
that underpin your organization's digital ecosystem.

### Efficient data exposure
Effortlessly transform your data sources into API endpoints or services with MI for VS Code, 
a streamlined process that takes just minutes. 
Our integrated data integration wizard will provide step-by-step guidance throughout the creation process.


### Simplified complex data transformation
Streamline intricate data transformation tasks without the need for manual coding. 
By harnessing out-of-the-box tools such as FreeMarker Templates and XSLT, you can efficiently 
and expeditiously convert and transfer data between various systems.


### Visual data mapping
This comprehensive solution includes an intuitive visual data mapper designed to facilitate data transformation 
from diverse formats, such as JSON, XML, and CSV. The drag-and-drop graphical interface empowers users to effortlessly 
create data transformation workflows without the necessity for manual coding.
