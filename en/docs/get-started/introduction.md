When deployed as an ESB, the platform supports message routing, transformation, message mediation, 
service orchestration, and any enterprise integration pattern.

## Connectors and Templates

### Extensive repository of pre-configured connectors
This comprehensive offering facilitates swift connectivity to a broad spectrum of systems, encompassing payments, 
CRM, ERP, social networks, and core services. Our repository comprises more than 200 enterprise-ready connectors. 
Moreover, it comes equipped with adapters designed for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems such as SAP, 
IBM WebSphere MQ, Oracle AQ, and MSMQ.

### Seamless custom connector development
Our platform streamlines the process of crafting bespoke connectors. 
Utilizing Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Web APIs, you can effortlessly construct custom connectors that 
possess the capacity to interface with any system, regardless of its underlying technology.

### Enhancing efficiency and conformity
We offer a collection of pre-established integration templates, empowering you to promptly initiate new projects 
by employing established patterns. These templates are fully adaptable, 
ensuring they can be tailored to your precise requirements. Additionally, 
you have the flexibility to create your own templates and patterns, 
enabling a tailored approach that suits your unique needs.

## Powerful data transformation and data integration
Data plays a pivotal role in driving business operations. 
Given the unique data handling methods across different systems, the expeditious extraction 
and utilization of this data is paramount for the development of contemporary applications and services 
that underpin your organization's digital ecosystem.

### Efficient data exposure
