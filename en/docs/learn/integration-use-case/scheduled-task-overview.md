# Periodic Execution of Integration Processes

Executing an integration process at a specified time is another common requirement in enterprise integration. For example, in an organization, there can be a need for running an integration process to synchronize two systems every day at the day end.  

In WSO2 Integrator: MI, execution of a message mediation process can be automated to run periodically by using a 'Scheduled trigger'. You can schedule a task to run in the time interval of 't' for 'n' number of times or to run once the WSO2 Integrator: MI starts. 

Furthermore, you can use cron expressions for more advanced executing time configuration.
